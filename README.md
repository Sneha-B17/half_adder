## 📚 Description

A half adder is a combinational logic circuit that adds two single-bit binary numbers. It produces a sum and a carry output.

### 🧠 Truth Table

| A | B | Sum | Carry |
|---|---|-----|--------|
| 0 | 0 |  0  |   0    |
| 0 | 1 |  1  |   0    |
| 1 | 0 |  1  |   0    |
| 1 | 1 |  0  |   1    |
